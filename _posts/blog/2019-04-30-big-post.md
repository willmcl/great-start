All about mad graffiti. 

**Oh trees**, you have so many branches, but I canâ€™t draw them all so I cut most of them off.

**Oh trees**, sometimes your trunk is darker than your leaves, sometimes the other way around,

How am I meant to keep up?

**Oh trees**, it is overwelming trying to draw you, this is because you have hundreds of thousands of leaves.

**Oh trees**, Am I meant to draw every leaf? Or just draw a bulky circle round each clump of your leaves and use my pencil to mirror the texture of many leaves together?

Please tell me, oh trees.



_Stay tuned next month for an ode to people sitting down for lunch._
