## Overview

The idea for this exercise came when brainstorming for a client website. GML Heritage is one of Australiaâ€™s leading heritage consultancies and carries out projects all over Australia. Each project is defined by its location. Could we turn that location into a part of the brand? Could we generate a colour from that location and thereby create a colour scheme that is truely unique to GML?

Whilst the concept never got picked up this exercise explores the possibility. It can take a list of locations with latitude and longitude and position them relative to a base location around the viewport. They will each be given a programatically generated colour also relative to the base location.
